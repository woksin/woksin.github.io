        Participated in a weekend Hackathon working on Norwegian Red Cross' CBS (Community Based Surveillance).
        Became a Core-team member of the project helping with the technical solution on a more regular basis and also helped out during later hackathons that we arranged.
        
        In 2019 we also took the hackathon to Senegal where we over a course of 5 days worked on this project together with enthusiastic and skilled developers there.
