I am a curious and passionate software engineer who thrives on solving real problems for real users. While I enjoy working across all aspects of software and product development, I often find myself drawn to the lower levels of the underlying software infrastructure ‚Äî designing and building tools, frameworks, and architectures that empower other developers to be more productive and deliver better software. There is something deeply satisfying about improving workflows, enabling efficiency, and creating robust systems that stand the test of time.

I take a bird‚Äôs-eye perspective when working on software ‚Äî balancing short-term goals with long-term maintainability. The real challenge of software engineering isn't just delivering Version 1, but ensuring that the software remains adaptable, scalable, and maintainable throughout its lifecycle. I thoroughly believe in systems design and the importance of focusing on how a problem can be viewed as a flow of information and interactions. Information systems are inherently understood by the flow of information and state within the system. My passion for Event Modeling, Event Sourcing and Continuous Delivery reflects this mindset, allowing me to build systems that are resilient and evolve gracefully.

Beyond coding, I enjoy collaborating with stakeholders to shape product roadmaps and break down complex objectives into digestible, actionable steps for teams. My experience spans multiple facets and industries, from finance and cloud infrastructure and DevOps to open-source development, architecture, infrastructure and DevEx. I am always eager to learn, experiment, listen and expand my understanding of software engineering and technology.

Outside of work, I dedicate time to open-source contributions, watching talks and reading articles on software engineering.
